In this project, I am creating how to run CRUD functionalities in a NextJs application using MongoDB.
Below are the steps:

1. Start by creating a new NextJs project.
N.B: You must have Node installed in your system.

2. Install Mongoose using `npm i mongoose` for MongoDB connection.

3. Install React icons using `npm i react-icons`. You can still install any other icon of your choice if you don't like react-icons.

4. Create a navbar component with links that lead to;
    4a. Home page 
    4b. Add Topic page

5. Create the list of topics that will have;
    5a. Title
    5b. Description 
    5c. Icon for delete
    5d. Icon for edit
