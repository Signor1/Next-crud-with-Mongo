In this project, I am creating how to run CRUD functionalities in a NextJs application using MongoDB.
Below are the steps:

1. Start by creating a new NextJs project.
N.B: You must have Node installed in your system.

2. Install Mongoose using `npm i mongoose` for MongoDB connection.

3. Install React icons using `npm i react-icons`. You can still install any other icon of your choice if you don't like react-icons.

4. Create a navbar component with links that lead to;
    4a. Home page 
    4b. Add Topic page

5. Create the list of topics that will have;
    5a. Title
    5b. Description 
    5c. Icon for delete (component)
    5d. Icon for edit (Link)

6. Create the `Add topic page` for creating new topics


7. Create the `Edit topic page` for editing and updating topics. The page will pick the details (title and description) of a topic and edit them.

8. Creating an account in Mongo Atlas 

9. Create a new project after creating account 

10. Build or create your database 

11. Create a username and password to the database 

12. Copy the username and password to be used as environment variables 

13. After the setup, click on `Finish` and click on `connect`. Choose Mongo for VsCode and copy the url.

14. Paste the url inside your .env and edit it while assigning it to a variable

15. After, Create a folder in your project directory. Name it libs and create a js file inside for database connection. 

16. After writing the code for database connect, next is to create a new folder in your project directory for database models. The folder will contain a js file for model definitions

17. Create an api folder inside the app folder. create topics folder inside the api folder. And lastly create a route.js file inside the topics folder. This route.js file will process the following:

i. the post topic request and insertion of topics into the database. 
ii. the get topics request 
iii. the delete topic request by id
